    question: "Which online Casino is the best?",
    answer: `It's impossible to pick one casino as the best choice for everyone. 
        As each player has different needs and preferences, the best online casino 
        for one player might be a terrible choice for someone else. That said, we've 
        reviewed thousands of casinos to find out how they treat their players, and 
        then considered local factors for each country with the help of local testers. 
        Casinos are then ordered from best to worst based on our findings, so you 
        should be able to find your best pick near the top of this list.`,

    question: "Can I win real money from online Casinos?",
    answer: `All casino games have a certain house edge, which means the casino always 
        have an advantage. You can, however, get lucky and hit a win despite the 
        unfavorable odds. That said, if you keep playing, you are much more likely 
        to end up with a loss than a profit. If you manage to win, we advise you to 
        withdraw your money, because you will certainly lose if you keep wagering 
        your money over and over again. We have seen many players who managed to win 
        tens of thousands of euros and then gradually lost all of it during the next 
        few days or weeks (or even faster) because they kept playing and didn't 
        withdraw their winnings. That's why we recommend players to be smarter that 
        that and take their winnings if they get lucky and win. And it always helps 
        to play in reputable online casinos.`,

    question: "Are online Casinos safe?",
    answer: `There are reputable online casinos, but there are also casinos with bad intentions. 
    If you choose an honest and reputable casino to play at, you can be pretty much sure that you 
    will be treated well, and your winnings will be paid out to you unless you really do something 
    against the rules. However, if you play at a casino with a bad reputation, it’s much more likely 
    that you will run into issues, e.g. casino looking for excuses not to pay out your winnings, etc. 
    That’s why we stress the importance of casino selection as much as we do.`,

    question: "How fair are online Casinos?",
    answer: `All casino games give the casino a certain statistical advantage (house edge), so you are more 
    likely to lose money than to win. However, if you think that casinos manipulate games to give them an 
    even bigger advantage than the advertised house edge, that’s not the case. Casino games are operated by 
    the company which created them, not by the casino itself, so the casino can’t influence the outcome of 
    game rounds at all. The only exception to this are fake games, which are created to resemble other 
    original games, but with a different set of payouts and probabilities. Fake games are generally used 
    by dishonest online casinos to trick players and increase their profits, but you will not find them 
    at any casino which has a good rating from us. If we discover fake games at a casino during the review 
    process, we decrease the casino’s rating and warn our visitors.`,
